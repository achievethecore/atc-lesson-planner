  and strategies using probability concepts (e.g., product testing, medical
  testing, pulling a hockey goalie at the end of a game).</option><option value="MP.1">MP.1: Make sense of
  problems and persevere in solving them. Mathematically proficient students start by explaining to themselves
  the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They
  analyze givens, constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures
  about the form and meaning of the solution and plan a solution pathway rather
  than simply jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous
  problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in
  order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their
  progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on
  the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing
  window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need.
  Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between
  equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of
  important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity
  or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures
  to help conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students
  check their answers to problems using a different method, and they
  continually ask themselves, "Does this make sense?" They can
  understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify
  correspondences between different approaches.</option><option value="MP.2">MP.2: Reason abstractly
  and quantitatively. Mathematically
  proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships in
  problem situations. They bring two complementary abilities to bear on
  problems involving quantitative relationships: the ability to &lt;i&gt;decontextualize&lt;/i&gt;—to abstract a
  given situation and represent it symbolically and manipulate the representing
  symbols as if they have a life of their own, without necessarily attending to
  their referents—and the ability to &lt;i&gt;contextualize&lt;/i&gt;, to pause as needed during the manipulation process in order
  to probe into the referents for the symbols involved. Quantitative reasoning
  entails habits of creating a coherent representation of the problem at hand;
  considering the units involved; attending to the meaning of quantities, not
  just how to compute them; and knowing and flexibly using different properties
  of operations and objects.</option><option value="MP.3">MP.3: Construct viable
  arguments and critique the reasoning of others. Mathematically proficient students
  understand and use stated assumptions, definitions, and previously
  established results in constructing arguments. They make conjectures and
  build a logical progression of statements to explore the truth of their
  conjectures. They are able to analyze situations by breaking them into cases,
  and can recognize and use counterexamples. They justify their conclusions,
  communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They
  reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into
  account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient
  students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible
  arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed,
  and—if there is a flaw in an argument—explain what it is. Elementary students
  can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings,
  diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even
  though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later,
  students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies. Students at
  all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether they
  make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.</option><option value="MP.4">MP.4: Model with
  mathematics. Mathematically proficient
  students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in
  everyday life, society, and the workplace. In early grades, this might be as
  simple as writing an addition equation to describe a situation. In middle
  grades, a student might apply proportional reasoning to plan a school event
  or analyze a problem in the community. By high school, a student might use
  geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one
  quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students
  who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and
  approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may
  need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a
  practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams,
  two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those
  relationships mathematically to draw conclusions. They routinely interpret
  their mathematical results in the context of the situation and reflect on
  whether the results make sense, possibly improving the model if it has not
  served its purpose.</option><option value="MP.5">MP.5: Use appropriate
  tools strategically. Mathematically
  proficient students consider the available tools when solving a mathematical
  problem. These tools might include pencil and paper, concrete models, a
  ruler, a protractor, a calculator, a spreadsheet, a computer algebra system,
  a statistical package, or dynamic geometry software. Proficient students are
  sufficiently familiar with tools appropriate for their grade or course to
  make sound decisions about when each of these tools might be helpful,
  recognizing both the insight to be gained and their limitations. For example,
  mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions
  and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible
  errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge.
  When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to
  visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and
  compare predictions with data. Mathematically proficient students at various
  grade levels are able to identify relevant external mathematical resources,
  such as digital content located on a website, and use them to pose or solve
  problems. They are able to use technological tools to explore and deepen
  their understanding of concepts.</option><option value="MP.6">MP.6: Attend to
  precision. Mathematically proficient
  students try to communicate precisely to others. They try to use clear
  definitions in discussion with others and in their own reasoning. They state
  the meaning of the symbols they choose, including using the equal sign
  consistently and appropriately. They are careful about specifying units of
  measure, and labeling axes to clarify the correspondence with quantities in a
  problem. They calculate accurately and efficiently, express numerical answers
  with a degree of precision appropriate for the problem context. In the
  elementary grades, students give carefully formulated explanations to each
  other. By the time they reach high school they have learned to examine claims
  and make explicit use of definitions.</option><option value="MP.7">MP.7: Look for and make
  use of structure. Mathematically
  proficient students look closely to discern a pattern or structure. Young
  students, for example, might notice that three and seven more is the same
  amount as seven and three more, or they may sort a collection of shapes
  according to how many sides the shapes have. Later, students will see 7 × 8
  equals the well remembered 7 × 5 + 7 × 3, in preparation for learning about
  the distributive property. In the expression &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 9&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; + 14, older students can see the
  14 as 2 × 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an
  existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an
  auxiliary line for solving problems. They also can step back for an overview
  and shift perspective. They can see complicated things, such as some
  algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several
  objects. For example, they can see 5 - 3(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; – &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;)2
  as 5 minus a positive number times a square and use that to realize that its
  value cannot be more than 5 for any real numbers &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;.</option><option value="MP.8">MP.8: Look for and express
  regularity in repeated reasoning. Mathematically proficient students notice if calculations are
  repeated, and look both for general methods and for shortcuts. Upper
  elementary students might notice when dividing 25 by 11 that they are
  repeating the same calculations over and over again, and conclude they have a
  repeating decimal. By paying attention to the calculation of slope as they
  repeatedly check whether points are on the line through (1, 2) with slope 3,
  middle school students might abstract the equation (&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; – 2)/(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
  – 1) = 3. Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; – 1)(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; + 1), (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; – 1)(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; +
  1), and (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; – 1)(&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; +
  1) might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series.
  As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain
  oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually
  evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.</option></select>
